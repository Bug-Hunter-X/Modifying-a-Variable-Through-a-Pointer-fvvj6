This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates a common coding error: modifying a variable through a pointer. The program initializes an integer variable x to 10 and then creates a pointer ptr that points to x. The value pointed to by ptr is then changed to 20. Finally, the value of x is printed to the console. The output of the program is 20, showing that the variable x has been successfully modified through the pointer. This example highlights the importance of understanding pointer arithmetic and memory management in C programming. Incorrect use of pointers can lead to unexpected and difficult-to-debug errors.
